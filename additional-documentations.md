# Drupal Able Player Module Documentation

Further enchancements to the [Drupal Able Player](https://www.drupal.org/project/ableplayer) created by Tony Cao for the UTSC Digital Scholarship Unit.

## Multiple Transcript Player

**Purpose:** Correct the bug in order to allow for the correct playing of multiple language transcripts alongside the audio/video.

**Relevant Code Modification:** The following modification in `ableplayer.min.js` within the function `AblePlayer.prototype.setupTracks` were made in order to achieve this:

```diff
...
(function (a, n) {
    a.src;
    return function (t, e) {
+        var vtt;
        var i = e,
        vtt = l.parseWebVTT(t, i);

        // Setup the language track and label for the captions
+        a.language = !jQuery.isEmptyObject(vtt.metadata)
+            ? vtt.metadata.lang.trim()
+            : "en";
+        a.label = l.getLanguageName(a.language);

        var r = a.language,
            o = a.label;
        s = vtt.cues;
    ...
```

_WebVTT Format:_ The following is a sample WebVTT file to specify a French transcript file (Note: it defaults to English if there is no language specified)

```
WEBVTT
lang:fr

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.000
J'ai appris Ã  faire demi-tour et tu es revenu

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.000

...
```

## Fixed and Draggable Transcript Container

**Purpose:** Give ability to have the transcript container either fixed under the media or allow it to be draggable as original designed. An option has been added to the on the settings menu for transcripts built within the player.

**Relevant Code Modification:** The following modification in `ableplayer.min.js` were made to accomodate this

```diff
AblePlayer.prototype.getAvailablePreferences:
...
    /* Add a new select option for fixed vs dragging transcript container */
+   t.push({
+       name: "prefTranscriptPosition",
+       label: this.tt.prefTranscriptPosition,
+       group: "transcript",
+       default: 0,
+   }),
...

AblePlayer.prototype.updatePrefs:
        ...
    0=== this.prefHighlight &&
        this.$transcriptDiv.find("span").removeClass("able-highlight"),
    this.updateCaption(),
    (this.refreshingDesc = !0),

    /* Check for new preferences update and then reload if necessary */
    this.initDescription(),
+   this.injectTranscriptArea(),
+   location.reload(),
...


AblePlayer.prototype.initDragDrop:
    /* Check if it was selected to have a dragable transcript container */
+   if (this.prefTranscriptPosition === 1) {
        var i, s, t, a, n, r;
        (i = this),
        ...
        ...
+   }

AblePlayer.prototype.endDrag:
    ...
    "keyboard" === this.dragDevice && i.focus(),
    (this.dragging = !1),

    /* Remove cookie to allow for page refresh and transcript area "reset" when changing between fixed and draggable */
-   this.updateCookie(t),

    (this.startMouseX = void 0),
    (this.startMouseY = void 0),
    ...
```

## Timestamp for Transcript Container

**Purpose:** Display transcript cues along with a time stamp and have the cues be displayed in a separate box for each similar to the old player.

**Relevant Code Modification:** The following modification in `ableplayer.min.js` were made to accomodate this

```diff
...
AblePlayer.prototype.generateTranscript:
    for (
        var a = o(e.components.children[s]), n = 0;
        n < a.length;
        n++
        ) {
            var r = a[n];
            "string" == typeof r &&
            (h.lyricsMode
            ? (r = r.replace("\n", "<br>") + "<br>")
            : (r += " ")),
            i.append(r);
            }
+           i.prepend("<i>[" + h.formatSecondsAsColonTime(e.start) + "]</i>"),
            i.attr("data-start", e.start.toString()),
            i.attr("data-end", e.end.toString()),
...
```

Along with the following CSS formatting in `ableplayer.min.css`:

```diff
-   .able-transcript div {
-    margin: 1em 0;
-   }

+   .able-transcript-caption {
+   border: 1px solid #ddd;
+   display: block;
+   padding: 10px 15px;
+   margin: 0px;
+   margin-bottom: -1px;
+   }
```

## Other Documentation

### Default Settings:

- Default width of the transcript container matches the width of the able player

### Configuration Menu:

The configuration menu for Ableplayer can be found by going to `Structure > Media Type > Video > Manage Display > Video File` then selecting on the settings gear. Same steps for audio files by choosing the audio option under media type.

Available Configurations Include:

- `Draggable Transcript Container`: Enable a draggable transcript container (i.e. the built-in one)
- `Show playback controls`: Double playback buttons
- `Autoplay`: Automatically start playing the media when landing on that page
- `Loop`: Repeat the media when over

### Transcript Text Formatting:

Transcript chunks are split based based off the presence of a **speaker** (i.e. it splits based off speaker chunks).
Example:
