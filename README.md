## Able Player

Able Player is a fully accessible cross-browser media player. It uses the HTML5 <audio> or <video> element for browsers that support them, and (optionally) the JW Player as a fallback for those that donâ€™t.

This module provides integration with the Libraries API for inclusion in Drupal sites.
